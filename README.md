Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is a subfield of engineering that deals with creating software products using precise scientific concepts, techniques and protocols.  

Traditional programming focuses more on technical coding while Software engineering is more focused on building the software's structure through computer science and engineering.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

Plan - Involves software requirements specification, cost benefit analysis, scheduling and resource estimation.

Design - Analyse requirements and identify the best solution to create software.

Implement - Analyse requirements to identify smaller coding tasks to do daily in achieving the final results.

Test - Quality analysis testing the sofware for errors and meeting the customer requirements.

Deploy - Code and test different copy of the software than the one users have access to.

Maintain - Resolution of bugs, customer issues and software changes.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

Waterfall models follow a linear sequence of stages, where each stage must be completed before moving to the next. Less flexible and harder to adapt to changes during the project. 

Agile models emphasize rapid iteration and flexibility. Work is divided into short bursts called “Sprints”, adapts well to changing requirements and feedback. 

Waterfall models would be preffered in projects with a defined scope, budget, and distributed crew. Agile would be suited in larger, more complicated projects where client feedback is easily accessible. 


Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

The procedure for determining, gathering, assessing, defining, verifying, and overseeing the requirements and expectations of those involved in a software system. 

An iterative process that involves requirements elicitation, requirements specification, requirements verification and validation, requirements management.

It is important in reducing software errors at the early stages of the development of software, if it can specify the requirement specification correctly, errors at later stages will be less.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Software components that are created by dividing the software. The software is divided into various components that work together to form a single functioning item at times they can perform as a complete function if not connected with each other.

Design patterns, such as Model-View-Controller and SOLID principles, promote modularity, flexibility readable code with meaningful variables and documentation makes maintenance tasks even smoother, scalability can improve the overall performance of a system by distributing the workload across multiple resources or servers.


Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit testing - Isolates each component of the software and then perform tests to illustrate that every individual component is accurately meeting the requirements and delivering the expected output. eg white box

Intergration testing - Verifies whether individual modules when combined work correctly or not as a group. eg grey box

System testing - Ensures that the software meets specified requirements and runs as smoothly as possible in its operating environment. eg end to end.

Acceptance testing - Evaluates whether the software complies with the end-user requirements and its readiness for deployment. eg alpha. 

It helps to ensure that the software works as intended, secure, reliable and user friendly.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Software tools that practice tracking and managing changes to source code over time.

Provides assistance to the developer team to efficiently communicate and track all changes made to the source code along with the information such as who made and what changes have been made all in improving productivity by making the development process smooth.

Git hub - Features local branching, multiple workflows, and convenient staging areas.
PerForce - Features security solution that protects the most valuable assets.
Apache Subversion - Features inventory management, security management and history tracking.

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in software projects?

They serve as a middleman between the development team and the other stakeholders in a software project.

Key responsibilities includes planning, scheduling, managing the delivery of software and web projects.

High competition levels owing to globalization.
Legacy systems and infrastructure issues. 
Finding the right project management resources and skilled talent pool.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

The process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs. 

Corrective Software Maintenance CM- Fixing errors as they occur and bugs.  

Preventative Software Maintenance PM- Scheduled replacements before parts break. Eg backup.  

Perfective Software Maintenance CbM- Maintenance based on specific situations or conditions.  

Adaptive Software Maintenance PdM- Data-driven maintenance impacted by preset parameters. Eg change in software/hardware.  

To ensure continous function as it was designed to and repairs/upgrades are performed as needed.


Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Algorithmic bias, personal data collection, weak security protection, negative relationship between feature and impact. 

Their products and related modifications must meet the highest professional standards possible.  

Advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest and have a good understanding of how the software will be used.
